Look at next:

icons (start with the usertools? Decide where icons are needed)
footnotes
* [[page name]]
breadcrumb
trace
* Too much white/gray space
* remove dashed line under downloadable
* alignment of usertools looks weird
check out old default and consider edit-page menu
* TOC looks unstyled, too much indentation

Anika todo:
